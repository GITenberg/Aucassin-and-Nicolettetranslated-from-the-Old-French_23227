7</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The story of Love, that simple theme with variations <i>ad
libitum</i>, <i>ad infinitum</i>, is never old, never stale,
never out-of-date.&nbsp; And as we sometimes seek rest from the
brilliant audacities and complex passions of Wagner or
Tschaikowsky in the tender simplicity of some ancient English
air, so we occasionally turn with relief from the wit and insight
and subtlety of our modern novelists to the old uncomplicated
tales of faerie or romance, and find them after all more moving,
more tender, even more real, than all the laboured realism of
these photographic days.&nbsp; And here before us is of all
pretty love-stories perhaps the prettiest.&nbsp; Idyllic as
Daphnis and Chloe, romantic as Romeo and Juliet, tender as
Undine, remote as Cupid and Psyche, yet with perpetual <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>touches
of actual life, and words that raise pictures; and lightened all
through with a dainty playfulness, as if Ariel himself had
hovered near all the time of its writing, and Puck now and again
shot a whisper of suggestion.</p>
<p>Yet it is only of late years that the charm of this story has
been truly appreciated.&nbsp; Composed probably in Northern
France, about the close of the twelfth century,&mdash;the time of
our own Angevin kings and the most brilliant period of Old-French
literature,&mdash;it has survived only in a single manuscript of
later date, where it is found hidden among a number of tales in
verse less pleasing in subject and far less delightful in
form.&nbsp; There it had lain unknown till discovered by M. de
Sainte-Palaye, and printed by him in modernised French in 1752,
one hundred and fifty years ago.&nbsp; There is no space here to
follow its fortunes since.&nbsp; Even after this revival it was
not till more than one hundred years later that it began to
attain to any wide recognition.&nbsp; And in England this
recognition <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>has been mainly due to Mr
Pater&rsquo;s delightful essay in his early work &ldquo;Studies
in the History of the Renaissance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the
publication of this book in 1873, the story of Aucassin and
Nicolette has had an ever-growing train of admirers both in
England and America, and various translations have appeared on
both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp; It has also been translated
into several other European languages, besides versions in modern
French.</p>
<p>The story, so far as the simple old-world plot is concerned,
is very probably not the original invention of whoever gave it
this particular form, any more than were the plots of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays of his own devising.&nbsp; It seems
likely that in origin it is Arabian or Moorish, and its
birthplace not Provence but Spain.&nbsp; Possibly it sprung, as
so much of the best poetry and story has sprung, from the
touching of two races, and the part friction part fusion of two
religions, in this case of the Moor and the Christian.&nbsp;
There was in 1019 a Moorish king of Cordova named Alcazin.&nbsp;
Turn this name <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>into French and we have
Aucassin.&nbsp; And to reverse the r&ocirc;les of Christian and
heathen is a very usual device for a story-teller transplanting a
story from another country to his own.&nbsp; Though the scene is
nominally laid in Provence there are a good many signs of a
Spanish origin in the places mentioned.&nbsp; By Carthage is
meant, not the city of Dido, but Carthagena; and thus the husband
devised for Nicolette is &ldquo;one of the greatest kings in all
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Valence again might originally have been not
the Valence on the Rhone, but Valence le grand, or
Valentia.&nbsp; And it is curious to observe that Beaucaire is
closely connected with Tarascon&mdash;a bridge across the Rhone
unites them&mdash;and that this latter name nearly resembles
Tarragona, a place which in other French romances is actually
called Terrascoigne.&nbsp; The shipwreck which in the story takes
place, impossibly, at Beaucaire, may have originally happened,
quite naturally, at Tarragona.&nbsp; Even the nonsense-name,
Torelore, might easily have had its rise in Torello.&nbsp; Again,
though it has been shown that all modern <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>reports of
the <i>Couvade</i> as existing in Biscay have been founded only
on the ancient assertion of Strabo, it is still remarkable that
it is in this part of Europe alone that the custom has ever been
found.</p>
<p>If the composer of Aucassin derived his story from such a
source, it is easy to see also whence he got the idea of the
special form he has given it; for a narrative in prose mingled
with interludes of verse, though strange to European literature,
is common in Arabian.</p>
<p>And yet, whatever his sources or his models, one feels that
his debt to them is trifling compared to the worth of his own
work.&nbsp; All that he describes he has seen with his own eyes;
and all that he tells, be it borrowed or invented, is quickened
and heightened and made immortal by his own touch upon it.</p>
<p>All who can should read this story in its own
language&mdash;the simple easy-flowing Old-French, with its
infantile syntax, and na&iuml;ve but effective <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>efforts at
distinction and what we now call style.&nbsp; There are various
editions of the old French text; but the two easiest to get and
also to read are that of Professor Suchier, and my own.&nbsp;
Those in search of learning will always turn to Germany, and
Suchier is a very learned man.&nbsp; But I can honestly advise
all English readers to get my edition (Macmillan, 1897) in which
the text is given as pure as I could draw it from the fountain
head, the original MS. at Paris; where the music to the verse
sections will be found printed in its proper notation; and which
contains also a literal translation, full notes, and a
glossary.</p>
<p>The present translation varies a good deal from that I printed
with the Old-French text.&nbsp; I have to some extent relaxed the
restrictions I imposed on myself there, and have given freer
turns, even verging occasionally on paraphrase, to bring out the
full meaning, which it is often possible to miss in the original,
especially in the very condensed style of the <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>verses.&nbsp;
These changes will, I hope, make this version easy and pleasant
to read even by those who have no leisure or no inclination to
attempt the study of the Old-French itself.</p>

<h3>&rsquo;TIS OF AUCASSIN AND OF NICOLETTE</h3>
<p>Who would list a pleasant lay,<br />
Pastime of the old and grey?<br />
Of two lovers, children yet,<br />
Aucassin and Nicolette;<br />
Of the sorrows he went through,<br />
Of the great things he did do,<br />
All for his bright favoured may.<br />
Sweet the song is, fair the say,<br />
Full of art and full of grace.<br />
There is none in such ill case,<br />
Sad with sorrow, waste with care,<br />
Sick with sadness, if he hear,<br />
But shall in the hearing be<br />
Whole again and glad with glee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sweet the story.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>How Bulgarius Count of Valence made war upon Warren Count of
Beaucaire.&nbsp; And this war was so great, so marvellous, and so
mortal, that not a day dawned but there he was before the city,
at the gates, at the walls, at the fences, with knights a hundred
and men-at-arms ten thousand on foot and on horse; and he burned
his land, laid waste his country, and slew his liegemen.&nbsp;
Warren, Count of Beaucaire, was an old man and feeble, who had
overlived his term.&nbsp; He had none to succeed him, neither son
nor daughter, save one only boy; and what he was like, I will
tell you.&nbsp; Aucassin was the young lord&rsquo;s name, and a
pretty lad he was.&nbsp; He had golden hair in little curls, and
laughing blue eyes, a face fair of colour and fine of curve, and
a proud shapely nose.&nbsp; Aye, so endued was he with good
conditions that there was none bad in him, but good only.&nbsp;
But so overcome was he of Love, who masters all, that he refused
knighthood, abjured arms, shunned the tourney, and left undone
all his devoir.</p>
<p>His father and his mother would say to him: &ldquo;Son! come,
take thine arms and to horse!&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Fight for thy
land and succour thy liegemen!&nbsp; If they see thee in the
midst of them, they will fight the better for their lives and
their havings and for thy land and mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;to what purpose is
this oration?&nbsp; Never God give me ought that I ask of Him, if
I take knighthood or mount horse, if I face fight or battlefield
to smite knight or be myself smitten, if you give me not
Nicolette, my sweet friend whom I love so well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;it cannot
be.&nbsp; Have done with Nicolette!&nbsp; She is a slave-girl,
carried captive from a foreign land.&nbsp; The Viscount of this
place bought her of the heathen, and brought her here.&nbsp; He
held her at the font, and christened her, and stood godfather to
her.&nbsp; Some day he will give her a young fellow to win bread
for her in wedlock.&nbsp; What is this to you?&nbsp; If you want
a wife, I will give you a king&rsquo;s daughter or a
count&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There is never so rich a man in France but
you shall have his daughter, if you want her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack, father!&rdquo; said Aucassin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
now is honour on earth so high, which Nicolette my sweet friend
would not grace if it were hers?&nbsp; Were she Empress of
Constantinople <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>or of Germany, were she Queen of
France or of England, there were but little in it, so noble is
she and gracious and debonair and endued with all good
conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin was of Beaucaire;<br />
His was the fine castle there;<br />
But on slender Nicolette<br />
Past man&rsquo;s moving is he set,<br />
Whom his father doth refuse;<br />
Menace did his mother use:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out upon thee, foolish boy!<br />
Nicolette is but a toy,<br />
Castaway from Carthagen,<br />
Bought a slave of heathen men.<br />
If for marrying thou be,<br />
Take a wife of high degree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I will none but her.<br />
Hath she not the gentle air,<br />
Grace of limb, and beauty bright?<br />
I am snared in her delight.<br />
If I love her &rsquo;tis but meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So passing sweet!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>When Warren Count of Beaucaire perceived that Aucassin his son
was not to be moved from his love of Nicolette, he betook him to
the Viscount of the place, who was his liegeman; and addressed
him thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Viscount, come, rid me of Nicolette your
god-daughter!&nbsp; A curse on the land whence ever she was
fetched to this country!&nbsp; Now Aucassin is lost to me, and
all because of her.&nbsp; He refuses knighthood and leaves undone
all his devoir.&nbsp; Rest assured that if I can get hold of her
I will burn her in a fire; and for yourself too you may fear the
worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Viscount, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis grief
to me that he go to her, or come to her, or speak to her.&nbsp; I
had bought her with my poor pieces.&nbsp; I had held her at the
font, and christened her, and stood god-father to her; and I
would have given her a young fellow to win bread for her in
wedlock.&nbsp; What is this to Aucassin your son?&nbsp; But
seeing your will is so and your good pleasure, I will send her to
such a land and to such a country that he shall never set eyes on
her more.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;See you do so!&rdquo; said Count Warren.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Else it might go ill with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus they parted.&nbsp; Now the Viscount was a very rich man,
and had a fine palace with a garden before it.&nbsp; He had
Nicolette put in a room there, on an upper storey, with an old
woman for company; and he had bread put there, and meat and wine
and all they needed.&nbsp; Then he had the door locked, so that
there was no way to get in or out.&nbsp; Only there was a window
of no great size which looked on the garden and gave them a
little fresh air.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Nicolette is prisoner,<br />
In a vaulted bed-chamber,<br />
Strange of pattern and design,<br />
Richly painted, rarely fine.<br />
At the window-sill of stone<br />
Leaned the maiden sad and lone.<br />
Yellow was her shining hair,<br />
And her eyebrow pencilled rare,<br />
Face fine-curved and colour fair:<br />
Never saw you lovelier.<br />
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Gazed she o&rsquo;er the garden-ground,<br />
Saw the opening roses round,<br />
Heard the birds sing merrily;<br />
Then she made her orphan cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe&rsquo;s me! what a wretch am I!<br />
Caged and captive, why, ah why?<br />
Aucassin, young lord, prithee,<br />
Your sweetheart, am I not she?<br />
Ay, methinks you hate not me.<br />
For your sake I&rsquo;m prisoner,<br />
In this vaulted bed-chamber,<br />
Where my life&rsquo;s a weary one.<br />
But by God, sweet Mary&rsquo;s son,<br />
Long herein I will not stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I find way!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Nicolette was in prison, as you have harkened and heard, in
the chamber.&nbsp; The cry and the noise ran through all the land
and through all the country that Nicolette was lost.&nbsp; There
are some say she is fled abroad out of the land.&nbsp; Other some
that Warren, Count of Beaucaire, has had her done to death.&nbsp;
Rejoice who might, Aucassin was not well pleased.&nbsp; But he
went <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>straightway to the Viscount of the place, and thus
addressed him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Viscount, what have you done with Nicolette, my
very sweet friend, the thing that I love best in all the
world?&nbsp; Have you stolen and taken her from me?&nbsp; Rest
assured that if I die of this thing, my blood will be required of
you; and very justly, when you have gone and killed me with your
two hands.&nbsp; For you have stolen from me the thing that I
love best in all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sir,&rdquo; said the Viscount, &ldquo;now let
be!&nbsp; Nicolette is a slave-girl whom I fetched from a foreign
land and bought for money of the heathen.&nbsp; I held her at the
font, and christened her and stood godfather to her, and have
brought her up.&nbsp; One of these days I would have given her a
young fellow to win bread for her in wedlock.&nbsp; What is this
to you?&nbsp; Take you some king&rsquo;s daughter or some
count&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Moreover, what were you profited, think you,
had you made her your concubine, or taken her to live with
you?&nbsp; Mighty little had you got by that, seeing that your
soul would be in Hell for ever and ever, for to Paradise you
would never win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paradise?&nbsp; What have I to do there?&nbsp; I seek
not to win Paradise, so I have Nicolette <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>my sweet
friend whom I love so well.&nbsp; For none go to Paradise but
I&rsquo;ll tell you who.&nbsp; Your old priests and your old
cripples, and the halt and maimed, who are down on their knees
day and night, before altars and in old crypts; these also that
wear mangy old cloaks, or go in rags and tatters, shivering and
shoeless and showing their sores, and who die of hunger and want
and cold and misery.&nbsp; Such are they who go to Paradise; and
what have I to do with them?&nbsp; Hell is the place for
me.&nbsp; For to Hell go the fine churchmen, and the fine
knights, killed in the tourney or in some grand war, the brave
soldiers and the gallant gentlemen.&nbsp; With them will I
go.&nbsp; There go also the fair gracious ladies who have lovers
two or three beside their lord.&nbsp; There go the gold and the
silver, the sables and ermines.&nbsp; There go the harpers and
the minstrels and the kings of the earth.&nbsp; With them will I
go, so I have Nicolette my most sweet friend with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo; faith,&rdquo; said the Viscount,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis but vain to speak of it; you will see her no
more.&nbsp; Aye, were you to get speech of her and it came to
your father&rsquo;s ears, he would burn both her and me in a
fire; and for yourself too you might fear the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;This is sore news to me,&rdquo; said
Aucassin.&nbsp; And he departed from the Viscount, sorrowful.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin has turned once more<br />
In wanhope and sorrow sore<br />
For his love-friend bright of face.<br />
None can help his evil case,<br />
None a word of counsel say.<br />
To the palace went his way;<br />
Step by step he climbed the stair;<br />
Entered in a chamber there.<br />
Then he &rsquo;gan to weep alone,<br />
And most dismally to groan,<br />
And his lady to bemoan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicolette, ah, gracious air!<br />
Coming, going, ever fair!<br />
In thy talk and in thy toying,<br />
In thy jest and in thy joying,<br />
In thy kissing, in thy coying.<br />
I am sore distressed for thee.<br />
Such a woe has come on me<br />
That I trow not to win free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet sister friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>At the same time that Aucassin was in the chamber, bemoaning
Nicolette his friend, Bulgarius Count of Valence, who had his war
to maintain, forgat it not; but he had summoned his men, foot and
horse, and advanced to assault the castle.&nbsp; And the cry went
up and the noise; and the knights and men-at-arms girt on their
armour, and hastened to the gates and walls to defend the castle;
while the townsfolk mounted the parapets and hurled bolts and
sharpened stakes.&nbsp; At the time when the assault was fast and
furious, Warren Count of Beaucaire came into the chamber where
Aucassin was weeping and bemoaning Nicolette his most sweet
friend whom he loved so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my son!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wretch that
thou art and unhappy, to see assault made on this thy
castle&mdash;none better nor more strong!&nbsp; Know, moreover,
that if thou lose it thou losest thine inheritance!&nbsp; Come
now, my son, take thine arms and to horse!&nbsp; Fight for thy
land, and succour thy liegemen, and get thee to the field!&nbsp;
Though thou strike never a man nor be thyself <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>stricken, if
they but see thee among them they will make a better fight for
their lives and their havings, and for thy land and mine.&nbsp;
So tall art thou and so strong, &rsquo;tis no great thing to do;
and it is thy devoir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;to what purpose is
this oration?&nbsp; Never God give me ought that I ask of him, if
I take knighthood or mount horse or go to the fighting to smite
knight or be myself smitten, if you give me not Nicolette, my
sweet friend, whom I love so well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;that cannot
be.&nbsp; Rather would I suffer loss of all my inheritance, aye,
of all I have, than that thou shouldst have her to woman or to
wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he turned to go.&nbsp; And when Aucassin saw him
departing, he called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;come hither, and I
will make a fair covenant with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, and what covenant, fair son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take arms and go to the fighting on such
condition, that, if God bring me again safe and sound, you will
give me leave to see Nicolette my sweet friend for such time as I
may speak two words to her or three, and once only kiss
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consent,&rdquo; said his father.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>So he made agreement with him, and Aucassin was
well-pleased.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin heard of the kiss<br />
On returning to be his.<br />
Hundred thousand marks pure gold<br />
Him had made less blithe and bold.<br />
Arms he called for, rich and rare;<br />
They made ready for his wear.<br />
Hauberk donned he, double-lined;<br />
Helmet on his head did bind;<br />
Girt his sword with hilt pure gold;<br />
Mounted on his charger bold;<br />
Spear and buckler then he took;<br />
At his two feet cast a look,<br />
In the stirrups trod they trim;<br />
Wondrous proud he carried him.<br />
His sweet friend&mdash;he thought on her,<br />
To his charger clapped the spur;<br />
Forth he springs full mettlesome;<br />
Straightway to the gate they come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That led to battle.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin was arrayed and mounted on his horse, as you have
harkened and heard.&nbsp; Lord! how well it became him&mdash;the
shield on his neck and the helm on his head and the sword-belt on
his left hip!&nbsp; And the boy was tall and strong and comely
and slim and well-grown; and the horse he bestrode was fleet of
foot and high of mettle, and the boy had put him through the gate
cleverly.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t you suppose that his thoughts
would have been set on taking spoil of oxen or cows or goats?
that he would have struck at some knight or been stricken in
turn?&nbsp; Not a whit! it never once occurred to him.&nbsp; But
his thought was so set upon Nicolette, his sweet friend, that he
forgot the reins and all he had to do.&nbsp; And his horse,
feeling the spur, dashed with him through the press, and charged
right into the thick of the enemy, who laid hands on him on all
sides, and made him prisoner.&nbsp; They took from him shield and
lance, and led him captive then and there.&nbsp; They were
already questioning one with another as to what manner of death
they should put him to; and when Aucassin heard it,</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;Ah, gracious Heaven!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
are these my mortal foes who hale me here and are presently about
to cut off my head?&nbsp; And once I have my head cut off,
nevermore shall I speak to Nicolette my sweet friend whom I love
so well.&nbsp; Nay, I have yet a good sword, and under me a good
steed untired.&nbsp; An I defend me not now for her sake,
ne&rsquo;er help her God if ever again she love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was tall and strong, and the horse beneath him was
eager.&nbsp; He put his hand to his sword and began to strike to
right and to left, slashing helmet and nose-guard, fist and
wrist, and making havoc all around him as the boar does when the
dogs set on him in the forest; so that he overthrew ten of their
knights and wounded seven; and charged then and there out of the
press, and rode back full gallop, sword in hand.</p>
<p>Bulgarius, Count of Valence, heard say that they were about to
hang Aucassin his enemy, and came that way.&nbsp; Aucassin failed
not to espy him; and gripping his sword, he smote him through the
helmet so that he clave it to the skull.&nbsp; He was so stunned
that he fell to earth; and Aucassin put out his hand and took him
prisoner, and led him off by the nose-guard <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of his
helmet, and delivered him to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;see here is your
enemy who has made war on you so long and done you hurt so
great.&nbsp; Twenty years has this war lasted, and never a man to
put an end to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair son,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;well were it
you should do deeds like this, and not gape at folly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;read me no
lectures, but keep me my covenant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! what covenant, fair son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack, father, have you forgotten it?&nbsp; By the head
of me, forget it who may, I do not mean to forget it.&nbsp;
Rather have I laid it much to heart.&nbsp; Did you not make this
covenant with me, that if I took arms and went out to the
fighting, and if God brought me back safe and sound, you would
let me see Nicolette my sweet friend for such time as I might
speak two words to her or three, and once only kiss her?&nbsp;
This covenant you made with me, and this covenant I will have you
keep with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, I?&rdquo; said his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er help me Heaven if I keep this covenant with
you! and were she here now I would burn her in a <!-- page
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>fire;
and for yourself too you might fear the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the whole conclusion?&rdquo; said Aucassin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;so help me
Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo; faith,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;then I am
very sorry that a man of your age should be a liar.&mdash;Count
of Valence, you are my prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is even so,&rdquo; said the Count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand!&rdquo; said Aucassin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, right willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his hand in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This you pledge me,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;that
never in all your days to be shall it be in your power to do
shame to my father or to do hurt to him or his, and you not do
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake, mock
me not, but set me a ransom!&nbsp; You can ask me nothing, gold
or silver, war-horses or palfreys, sables or ermines, hounds or
hawks, that I will not give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo; said Aucassin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wot you not
that you are my prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said the Count Bulgarius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er help me Heaven,&rdquo; said Aucassin, <!--

head a-flying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo; God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
give you what pledge you please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave the pledge; and Aucassin set him on a horse, and
himself mounted another, and conducted him till he was in
safety.</p>

34</span><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin was put in prison, as you have listened and heard,
and Nicolette was elsewhere in the chamber.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the
summer time, the month of May, when the days are warm and long
and bright, and the nights still and cloudless.&nbsp; Nicolette
lay one night in her bed, and saw the moon shine bright through a
window, and heard the nightingale sing in the garden; and she
remembered Aucassin her friend, whom she loved so well.&nbsp;
Then she fell a-thinking of Warren Count of Beaucaire, and how he
hated her to death; and she thought within herself that she would
abide there no longer; since if she were betrayed and Count
Warren knew of her, he would put her to an evil death.&nbsp; She
perceived that the old woman who was with her slept.&nbsp; And
she arose and clad her in a goodly gown that she had of
cloth-of-silk; and she took bedclothes and towels, and tied one
to other and made a rope as long as she could, and made it fast
to the window-shaft; and so got down into the garden.&nbsp; Then
she took her dress in one hand before, and in the other behind,
and girded herself, because of the dew <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>she saw heavy
on the grass, and went her way down the garden.&nbsp; She had
golden hair in little curls, and laughing blue eyes, and a face
finely curved, and a proud shapely nose, and lips more red than
cherry or rose in summertime, and small white teeth, and little
breasts that swelled beneath her clothes like two nuts of a
walnut-tree.&nbsp; And her waist was so fine that your two hands
could have girdled her; and the daisy-flowers snapped by her
toes, and lying on the arch of her foot, were fairly black beside
her feet and ankles, so very white the girl was.</p>
<p>She came to the postern, and unfastened it, and went out
through the streets of Beaucaire, keeping to the shadow, for the
moon shone very bright; and she went on till she came to the
tower where her friend was.&nbsp; The tower had cracks in it here
and there, and she crouched against one of the piers, and wrapped
herself in her mantle, and thrust her head into a chink in the
tower, which was old and ancient, and heard Aucassin within
weeping and making very great sorrow, and lamenting for his sweet
friend whom he loved so much.&nbsp; And when she had listened
enough to him she began to speak.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Nicolette the bright of face<br />
Leaned her at the buttress-base,<br />
Heard within her lover dear<br />
Weeping and bewailing her;<br />
Then she spake the thought in her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aucassin, most gentle knight,<br />
High-born lording, honoured wight,<br />
What avails you to weep so?<br />
What your wailing, what your woe?<br />
I may ne&rsquo;er your darling be,<br />
For your father hateth me;<br />
All your kin thereto agree.<br />
For your sake I&rsquo;ll pass the sea,<br />
Get me to some far countrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tresses of her hair she clipped,<br />
And within the tower slipped.<br />
Aucassin, that lover true,<br />
Took them and did honour due,<br />
Fondly kissed them and caressed,<br />
And bestowed them in his breast.<br />
Then in tears anew he brake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his love&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>When Aucassin heard Nicolette say that she would depart into
another country, he felt nothing but anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sweet friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you shall not
depart, for then would you have killed me.&nbsp; The first man
that set eyes on you and could do so would straightway lay hands
on you and take you to be his concubine.&nbsp; And once you had
lived with any man but me, now dream not that I should wait to
find a knife wherewith to strike me to the heart and kill
me!&nbsp; Nay, verily, that were all too long to wait.&nbsp;
Rather would I fling me just so far as I might see a bit of wall,
or a grey stone; and against that would I dash my head so hard
that my eyes should start out and all my brains be
scattered.&nbsp; Yet even such a death would I die rather than
know you had lived with any man but me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I trow not that you love me
so well as you say; but I love you better than you do
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack!&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;fair sweet
friend!&nbsp; That were not possible that you should love me <!--
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>so well as I do you.&nbsp; Woman cannot love man so well
as man loves woman.&nbsp; For a woman&rsquo;s love lies in her
eye, in bud of bosom or tip of toe.&nbsp; But a man&rsquo;s love
is within him, rooted in his heart, whence it cannot go
forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Aucassin and Nicolette were talking together, the town
watch came down a street.&nbsp; They had their swords drawn under
their cloaks, for Count Warren had given them command that if
they could lay hands on her they should kill her.&nbsp; And the
watchman on the tower saw them coming, and heard that they were
talking of Nicolette and threatening to kill her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what pity it were
should they slay so fair a maid!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere a mighty good
deed if I could tell her, in such wise that they perceived it
not, and she could be ware of them.&nbsp; For if they slay her,
then will Aucassin my young lord die; and that were great
pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Valiant was the watch on wall,<br />
Kindly, quick of wit withal.<br />
<!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Very seasonably gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maiden of the noble heart,<br />

Winsome is thy golden hair,<br />

Terribly they threaten thee.<br />
Soon they&rsquo;ll do thee some misdeed<br />

<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Nicolette; &ldquo;now may thy
father&rsquo;s soul and thy mother&rsquo;s be in blessed repose,
for <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>the grace and for the courtesy with which thou hast told
me!&nbsp; Please God I will guard me well from them, and may God
Himself be my guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wrapped her mantle about her in the shadow of the pier,
till they had passed.&nbsp; Then she took leave of Aucassin and
went her way till she came to the castle wall.&nbsp; There was a
breach in it which had been boarded up.&nbsp; On to this she
climbed, and so got over between the wall and the ditch; and
looking down she saw the ditch was very deep and the sides very
sheer, and she was sore afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, gracious Heaven!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if I let
myself fall I shall break my neck; and if I abide here, I shall
be taken to-morrow and burned in a fire.&nbsp; Nay, I had liefer
die here than be made a show to-morrow for all the folk to stare
at!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed herself, and let herself slip down into the
ditch.&nbsp; And when she came to the bottom, her fair feet and
her fair hands, untaught that ought could hurt them, were bruised
and <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>torn, and the blood flowed in full a dozen places.&nbsp;
Nevertheless she felt neither hurt nor pain for her great
dread.&nbsp; And if she were troubled as to the getting in, she
was far more troubled as to the getting out.&nbsp; But she
bethought her that it was no good to linger there; and she found
a sharpened stake which had been thrown by those within in the
defence of the castle; and with this she made steps one above the
other, and with much difficulty climbed up till she reached the
top.</p>
<p>Now hard by was the forest, within two bowshots.&nbsp; It
stretched full thirty leagues in length and in breadth, and had
wild beasts in it and snaky things.&nbsp; She was afraid that if
she went into it, these would kill her; and on the other hand she
bethought her that if she were found there she would be taken
back to the town to be burned.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Nicolette, that bright-faced may,<br />

<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Nicolette made great lamentation, as you have heard.&nbsp; She
commended herself to God, and went on till she came into the
forest.&nbsp; She durst not go deep into it, for the wild beasts
and the snaky things; and she crept into a thick bush, and sleep
fell on her.&nbsp; She slept <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>till the
morrow at high Prime, when the herdboys came out of the town, and
drove their beasts between the wood and the river.&nbsp; They
drew aside to a very beautiful spring which was at the edge of
the forest, and spread out a cloak and put their bread on
it.&nbsp; While they were eating, Nicolette awoke at the cry of
the birds and of the herdboys, and she sprang towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair children!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;may the Lord
help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God bless you!&rdquo; said the one who was more
ready of speech than the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair children,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;know you
Aucassin, the son of the Count Warren of Beaucaire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So God help you, fair children,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;tell him that there is a beast in this forest, and that he
come to hunt it.&nbsp; And if he can catch it he would not give
one limb of it for a hundred marks of gold, no, not for five
hundred, nor for any wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they gazed at her, and when they saw her so beautiful they
were all amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, I tell him?&rdquo; said he who was more ready of
speech than the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorrow be <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>his whoever
speak of it or whoever tell him!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis fantasy that
you say, since there is not so costly a beast in this forest,
neither stag nor lion nor wild boar, one of whose limbs were
worth more than two pence, or three at the most; and you speak of
so great wealth!&nbsp; Foul sorrow be his who believe you, or
whoever tell him!&nbsp; You are a fay, and we have no care for
your company.&nbsp; So keep on your way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fair children!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;this will
you do!&nbsp; The beast has such a medicine that Aucassin will be
cured of his hurt.&nbsp; And I have here five sous in my purse;

we take; and if he come here we will tell him, but we will never
go to seek him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicolette had made the bower, as you have harkened and heard;
very pretty she made it and very dainty, and all bedecked within
and without with flowers and leaves.&nbsp; Then she laid her down
near to the bower in a thick bush, to see what Aucassin would
do.</p>
<p>And the cry and the noise went through all the land and
through all the country that Nicolette was lost.&nbsp; There are
some say that she is fled away; other some that the Count Warren
has had her done to death.&nbsp; Rejoice who might, Aucassin was
not well pleased.&nbsp; Count Warren his father bade take him out
of prison; and summoned the knights of the land, and the
damozels, and made a very rich feast, thinking to comfort
Aucassin his son.&nbsp; But while the feasting was at its height,
there was Aucassin leaned against a balcony, all sorrowful and
all downcast.&nbsp; Make merry who might, Aucassin had no taste
for it; since he saw nothing there of that he loved.&nbsp; A
knight looked upon him, and came to him, and accosted him:</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

as yours, I too have been sick.&nbsp; I will give you good
counsel, if you will trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;gramercy!&nbsp; Good
counsel should I hold dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mount on a horse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and go by yon
forest side to divert you; there you will see the flowers and
green things, and hear the birds sing.&nbsp; Peradventure you
shall hear a word for which you shall be the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;gramercy!&nbsp; So
will I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stole from the hall, and descended the stairs, and came to
the stable where his horse was.&nbsp; He bade saddle and bridle
him; and setting foot in stirrup, he mounted and rode forth out
of the castle, and went on till he came to the forest.&nbsp; He
rode till he reached the spring, and came upon the herdboys at
the point of None.&nbsp; They had spread a cloak on the grass,
and were eating their bread and making very great merriment.</p>

Your sweet words and laughter blithe,<br />

<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin went through the forest this way and that way, and
his good steed carried him a great pace.&nbsp; Think not that the
briars and thorns spared him!&nbsp; Not a whit!&nbsp; Nay they
tore his clothes so, that &rsquo;twere hard work to have patched
them together again; and the blood flowed from his arms and his
sides and his legs in forty places or thirty; so that one could
have followed the boy by the trace of the blood that fell upon
the grass.&nbsp; But he thought so much on Nicolette, his sweet
friend, that he felt neither hurt nor pain.&nbsp; All day long he
rode through the forest, but so it was that he never heard news
of her.&nbsp; And, when he saw that evening drew on, he began to
weep because he found her not.</p>
<p>He was riding down an old grassy road, when he looked before
him in the way and saw a boy, <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and I will
tell you what he was like.&nbsp; He was tall of stature and
wonderful to see, so ugly and hideous.&nbsp; He had a monstrous
shock-head black as coal, and there was more than a full
palm-breadth between his two eyes; and he had great cheeks, and
an immense flat nose, with great wide nostrils, and thick lips
redder than a roast, and great ugly yellow teeth.&nbsp; He was
shod in leggings and shoes of ox-hide, laced with bast to above
the knee; and was wrapped in a cloak which seemed inside out
either way on, and was leaning on a great club.&nbsp; Aucassin
sprang to meet him, and was terrified at the nearer sight of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair brother, may God help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God bless you!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So God help you, what do you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matters it to you?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;; said Aucassin; &ldquo;I ask not for any
ill reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wherefore are you weeping,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and making such sorrow?&nbsp; I&rsquo; faith, were I as
rich a man as you are, all the world would not make me
weep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&nbsp; Do you know me?&rdquo; said Aucassin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye.&nbsp; I know well that you are Aucassin the son of
the Count; and if you tell me wherefore <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>you are
weeping I will tell you what I am doing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cert&egrave;s,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;I will tell
you right willingly.&nbsp; I came this morning to hunt in this
forest; and I had a white greyhound, the fairest in the world,
and I have lost it; &rsquo;tis for this I am weeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear him!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by the blessed heart!
and you wept for a stinking dog!&nbsp; Sorrow be his who ever
again hold you in account!&nbsp; Why there is no man in this land
so rich, of whom if your father asked ten, or fifteen, or twenty,
he would not give them only too willingly, and be only too
glad.&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;tis I should weep and make
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wherefore you, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I will tell you.&nbsp; I was hireling to a rich
farmer, and drove his plough&mdash;four oxen there were.&nbsp;
Three days since a great misfortune befell me.&nbsp; I lost the
best of my oxen, Roget, the best of my team; and I have been in
search of it ever since.&nbsp; I have neither eaten nor drunk
these three days past; and I dare not go into the town, as they
would put me in prison, since I have not wherewith to pay for
it.&nbsp; Worldly goods have I none worth ought but what you see
on the body of me.&nbsp; I have a mother, poor <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>woman, who
had nothing worth ought save one poor mattress, and this they
have dragged from under her back, so that she lies on the bare
straw; and for her I am troubled a deal more than for
myself.&nbsp; For wealth comes and goes; if I have lost now I
shall gain another time, and I shall pay for my ox when I can;
nor will I ever weep for an ox.&nbsp; And you wept for a dog of
the dunghill!&nbsp; Sorrow be his who ever again hold you in
account!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cert&egrave;s, you are of good comfort, fair
brother!&nbsp; Bless you for it!&nbsp; And what was thine ox
worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is twenty sous they ask me for it; I cannot
abate a single farthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;take these twenty
which I have in my purse, and pay for thine ox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Gramercy!&nbsp; And may God
grant you to find that which you seek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took leave of him; and Aucassin rode on.&nbsp; The night
was fine and still; and he went on till he came to the place
where the seven roads divide, and there before him he saw the
bower which Nicolette had made, bedecked within and without and
over and in front with flowers, and <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>so pretty
that prettier could not be.&nbsp; When Aucassin perceived it, he
drew rein all in a moment; and the light of the moon smote within
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Heaven!&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;here has
Nicolette been, my sweet friend; and this did she make with her
beautiful hands!&nbsp; For the sweetness of her, and for her
love, I will now alight here, and rest me there this night
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his foot out of the stirrup to alight.&nbsp; His horse
was big and high; and he was thinking so much on Nicolette, his
most sweet friend, that he fell on a stone so hard that his
shoulder flew out of place.&nbsp; He felt that he was badly hurt;
but he bestirred him the best he could, and tied his horse up
with his other hand to a thorn; and he turned over on his side,
so that he got into the bower on his back.&nbsp; And he looked
through a chink in the bower, and saw the stars in the sky; and
he saw one there brighter than the rest, and he began to say:</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little star, I see thee there,<br />
That the moon draws close to her!<br />
Nicolette is with thee there,<br />
My love of the golden hair.<br />

To become the lamp of even.</p>
<p>. . . . .<br />

<p>Whatsoe&rsquo;er the fall might be,<br />
Would I were aloft with thee!<br />
Straitly I would kiss thee there.<br />
Though a monarch&rsquo;s son I were,<br />
Yet would you befit me fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister, sweet friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>When Nicolette heard Aucassin she came to him, for she was not
far off.&nbsp; She came into <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the bower,
and threw her arms round his neck, and kissed and caressed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sweet friend, well be you met!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, fair sweet friend, be you the well
met!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed and caressed each other, and their joy was
beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sweet friend!&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;I was
but now sore hurt in my shoulder; and now I feel neither hurt nor
pain since I have you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt about, and found that he had his shoulder out of
place.&nbsp; She plied it so with her white hands, and achieved
(as God willed, who loveth lovers) that it came again into
place.&nbsp; And then she took flowers and fresh grass and green
leaves, and bound them on with the lappet of her smock, and he
was quite healed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aucassin,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;fair sweet friend,
take counsel what you will do!&nbsp; If your father makes them
search this forest to-morrow, and they find me&mdash;whatever may
become of you, they will kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cert&egrave;s, fair sweet friend, I should be much
grieved at that!&nbsp; But, an I be able, they shall never have
hold of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

him, kissing and caressing her; and they set out into the open
fields.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin, the boon, the blond,<br />
High-born youth and lover fond,<br />
Rode from out the deep forest;<br />
In his arms his love he pressed,<br />
&rsquo;Fore him on the saddle-bow;<br />
Kisses her on eyes and brow,<br />
On her mouth and on her chin.<br />
Then to him did she begin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aucassin, fair lover sweet,<br />
To what land are we to fleet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet my sweetheart, what know I?<br />
Nought to me &rsquo;tis where we fly,<br />
In greenwood or utter way,<br />
So I am with you alway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they pass by dale and down,<br />
By the burgh and by the town,<br />
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And alighted on the beach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Longside the strand.</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin had alighted, he and his love together, as you have
harkened and heard.&nbsp; He held his horse by the bridle and his
love by the hand, and they began to go along the shore; and they
went on till Aucassin descried some merchants who were in a ship
sailing near the shore.&nbsp; He beckoned to them and they came
to him; and he dealt with them so that they took him into their
ship.&nbsp; And when they were on the high sea a storm arose,
great and wonderful, which carried them from land to land, till
they arrived at a foreign land, and entered the port of the
castle of Torelore.&nbsp; Then they asked what land it was; and
they told them that it was the land of the king of
Torelore.&nbsp; Then he asked, Who was he, and was there
war?&nbsp; And they told him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, great war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took leave of the merchants, and they <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>commended him
to God.&nbsp; He mounted his horse, with his sword girt, and his
love before him, and went on till he came to the castle.&nbsp; He
asked where the king was, and they told him that he lay in
child-bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where then is his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they told him that she was with the army, and had taken
thither all the folk of the land.&nbsp; And when Aucassin heard
it, he thought it a very strange thing; and he came to the
palace, and alighted, he and his love together.&nbsp; And she
held his horse, and he went up to the palace, with his sword
girt; and went on till he came to the room where the king lay
a-bed.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin the room ent&rsquo;red,<br />
He the courteous, the high-bred,<br />
And went straight up to the bed,<br />
On the which the king was laid.<br />
Right in front of him he stayed,<br />
And so spake, hear what he said:<br />
<!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;Go to, fool!&nbsp; What dost thou
there?&rdquo;<br />
Quoth the king: &ldquo;A son I bear.<br />
Soon as is my month fulfilled,<br />
And I am quite whole and healed,<br />
Then shall I the mass go hear,<br />
As my ancestor did ere,<br />
And my great war to maintain<br />
&rsquo;Gainst mine enemies again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not leave it!&rdquo; <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>When Aucassin heard the king speak thus, he took all the
clothes which were on him, and flung them down the room.&nbsp; He
saw behind him a stick.&nbsp; He took it, and turned and struck
him, and beat him so that he was like to have killed him.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;Ah, fair sir!&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;what
is it you ask of me?&nbsp; Have you your wits distraught, you who
beat me in my own house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the heart of God,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;you
whoreson knave, I will kill you unless you give me your word that
never more shall any man in your land lie in
child-bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave him his word; and when he had given it,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;now take me where
your wife is with the army!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, right willingly!&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p>He mounted a horse, and Aucassin mounted his; and Nicolette
remained in the queen&rsquo;s chambers.&nbsp; And the king and
Aucassin rode till they came where the queen was; and they found
it a battle of crab-apples roasted, and eggs, and fresh
cheeses.&nbsp; And Aucassin began to gaze at them, and he
wondered very hard.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin has stayed him so,<br />
Elbow-propped on saddle-bow,<br />
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>And began a-gazing at<br />
This tremendous pitched combat.<br />
They had brought with them thereto<br />
Store of cheeses enow new,<br />
Wild crab-apples roasted through,<br />
And of great field-mushrooms too.<br />
He who best disturbs the fords<br />
Is proclaimed the chief of lords.<br />
Aucassin, the gallant knight,<br />
&rsquo;Gan a-gazing at the sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fell a-laughing.</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>When Aucassin saw this strange thing, he came to the king and
accosted him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;are these your
enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you that I should avenge you of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Aucassin put his hand to his sword, and dashed in among
them, and began to <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>strike to right and to left, and
killed many of them.&nbsp; And when the king saw that he was
killing them he took him by the bridle, and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fair sir!&nbsp; Do not kill them so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Aucassin. &ldquo;Do you not wish that
I should avenge you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you have done it
overmuch.&nbsp; It is not our custom to kill one
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other side turned to flight; and the king and Aucassin
returned to the Castle of Torelore.&nbsp; And the people of the
country bade the king drive Aucassin out of his land, and keep
Nicolette for his son, since she seemed in sooth a lady of high
degree.&nbsp; And when Nicolette heard it she was not
well-pleased; and she began to say,</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;King of Torelore!&rdquo; she said,<br />
Nicolette the lovely maid,<br />
&ldquo;Fool I seem in your folk&rsquo;s sight!<br />
When my sweet friend clips me tight,<br />
<!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Smooth and soft for his delight,<br />
Then am I at such a school,<br />
Ball nor dance nor gay carole,<br />
Harp nor viol nor cithole,<br />
Nor the pleasures of <i>nimpole</i>, <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were ought beside it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin was at the Castle of Torelore, and Nicolette his
love, in great content and in great delight, for he had with him
Nicolette, his sweet friend whom he loved so well.&nbsp; While he
was in such content and in such delight, a fleet of Saracens came
by sea and attacked the castle and took it by storm.&nbsp; They
took the stuff, and led away men-captives and
women-captives.&nbsp; They took Nicolette and Aucassin, and bound
Aucassin hand and foot and threw him into one <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>ship, and
Nicolette into another.&nbsp; And there arose a storm at sea
which parted them.&nbsp; The ship in which Aucassin was went
drifting over the sea till it arrived at the Castle of
Beaucaire.&nbsp; And when the people of the country ran to the
wrecking of it, they found Aucassin, and recognised him.&nbsp;
When the men of Beaucaire saw their young lord, they made great
joy of him; for Aucassin had stayed at the Castle of Torelore
full three years, and his father and mother were dead.&nbsp; They
brought him to the Castle of Beaucaire, and all became his
liegemen.&nbsp; And he held his land in peace.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Aucassin did thus repair<br />
To his city of Beaucaire;<br />
All the kingdom and countrie<br />
Held in great tranquillity.<br />
Swore he by God&rsquo;s majesty,<br />
Sorer far is his regret<br />
For bright-favoured Nicolette<br />
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Than his kinsfolk every one,<br />
Though they all were dead and gone.<br />
&ldquo;Sweet my sweetheart, bright of cheer,<br />
You to seek I know not where!<br />
Never God made that countrie,<br />
Overland or oversea,<br />
If I thought to light on thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not fly thither!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>Now we will leave Aucassin, and tell of Nicolette.&nbsp; The
ship in which Nicolette was, was the king of Carthage&rsquo;s,
and he was her father, and she had twelve brothers, all princes
or kings.&nbsp; When they saw Nicolette so beautiful, they did
her very great honour, and made rejoicing over her; and much they
questioned of her who she was; for in sooth she seemed a very
noble lady and of high degree.&nbsp; But she could not tell them
who she was; for she had been carried captive as a little
child.</p>
<p>They sailed till they came beneath the city <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>of
Carthage.&nbsp; And when Nicolette saw the walls of the castle,
and the country, she recognised that it was there she had been
brought up and carried captive as a little child; yet she was not
such a little child but that she knew well that she had been
daughter to the king of Carthage, and that she had been brought
up in the city.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Nicolette, the wise, the brave,<br />
Won to land from off the wave;<br />
Sees the wharves, the city walls,<br />
And the palaces and halls;<br />
Then she cries, &ldquo;Ah! woe is me!<br />
Ah, woe worth my high degree!<br />
King&rsquo;s daughter of Carthagen,<br />
To the Amiral akin!<br />
Here me holds a salvage horde!<br />
Aucassin, my gentle lord,<br />
Wise and worshipful and free,<br />
Your sweet love constraineth me,<br />
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Grant me God the Heavenly<br />
Yet to hold you in embrace,<br />
And that you should kiss my face<br />
And my mouth and all my cheer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My liege lord dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>When the king of Carthage heard Nicolette speak thus, he threw
his arms round her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sweet friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell me who
you are!&nbsp; Be not afraid of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am daughter to the king
of Carthage, and was carried captive as a little child, full
fifteen years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they heard her speak thus, they knew well that she said
truly; and they made very great rejoicing over her, and brought
her to the palace with great honour, as a king&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; A lord they wished to give her, a king of Paynim;
but she had no care to wed.&nbsp; And when she had been there
full three days or four, <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>she
considered with herself by what device she might go to seek
Aucassin.&nbsp; She procured a viol and learned to play on it;
till one day they wished to marry her to a king, a rich
Paynim.&nbsp; Then she stole away in the night, and came to the
seaport, and harboured her at the house of a poor woman on the
seashore.</p>
<p>And she took a herb, and smeared her head and face with it, so
that she was all black and stained.&nbsp; And she got a coat
made, and cloak and shirt and breeches, and attired herself in
minstrel guise; and she took her viol, and went to a mariner, and
so dealt with him that he took her in his ship.&nbsp; They set
their sail, and sailed over the high sea till they arrived at the
land of Provence.&nbsp; And Nicolette went forth, and took her
viol, and went playing through the country, till she came to the
Castle of Beaucaire, where Aucassin was.</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>At Beaucaire beneath the tower<br />
Aucassin was one fair hour.<br />
Here he sat him on a stair;<br />
Round him his proud barons were;<br />
Saw the flower and green herb spring,<br />
Heard the song-bird sweetly sing;<br />
Of his love he thought anew,<br />
Nicolette the maiden true,<br />
Whom he loved so long a day;<br />
Then to tears and sighs gave way.<br />
Look you, Nicolette below<br />
Draws her viol, draws her bow;<br />
Now she speaks, her tale tells so:<br />
&ldquo;List to me, proud lords arow,<br />
Those aloft and those alow!<br />
Would it please you hear a word<br />
Of Aucassin, a proud lord,<br />
And of Nicolette the bold?<br />
Long their love did last and hold<br />
Till he sought her in the wold.<br />
Then, from Torelore&rsquo;s stronghold,<br />
They were haled by heathen horde.<br />
Of Aucassin we&rsquo;ve no word.<br />
Nicolette the maiden bold<br />

Whom her father dear doth hold<br />
Who of yonder land is lord.<br />
Husband they would her award,<br />
Felon king of heathenesse.<br />
Nicolette cares not for this,<br />
For she loves a lording lad,<br />
Aucassin to name he had.<br />
By God and His name she vows<br />
Never lord will she espouse,<br />
If she have not her true love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so fain of.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Here they speak and tell the story</i>.</p>
<p>When Aucassin heard Nicolette speak thus, he was very glad,
and he took her on one side, and asked her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sweet comrade,&rdquo; said Aucassin, &ldquo;know
you ought of this Nicolette, of whom you have sung?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, yes!&nbsp; I know of her as the noblest creature
and the gentlest and wisest that ever was born.&nbsp; And she is
daughter to the king <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>of Carthage, who took her when
Aucassin was taken, and carried her to the city of Carthage, when
he knew surely that she was his daughter, and made very great
rejoicing over her.&nbsp; And every day they wish to give her for
lord one of the highest kings in all Spain.&nbsp; But she would
rather let herself be hanged or drowned than she would take any
of them, were he ever so rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fair sweet comrade,&rdquo; said the Count Aucassin,
&ldquo;if you would go back to that land, and would tell her to
come and speak to me, I would give you of my wealth as much as
you should dare ask or take.&nbsp; Know, moreover, that for the
love of her I will take no wife, were she of ever so high degree,
but I wait for her; nor will I ever have any wife save her.&nbsp;
And had I known where to find her I should not now have to seek
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if you would do this, I
would go to seek her, for your sake, and for hers, whom I love
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sware to her; and then he bade give her twenty
pounds.&nbsp; And as she took leave of him, he fell weeping for
the sweetness of Nicolette.&nbsp; And when she saw him
weeping,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;be not afraid!&nbsp; Since
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>within a little while I will bring her to you in this
town, so that you shall see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Aucassin heard it he was very glad.&nbsp; And she
took leave of him, and went into the town to the house of the
Viscountess; for the Viscount her godfather was dead.&nbsp; She
harboured her there; and spoke with her till she confessed her
affair to her, and the Viscountess recognised her, and knew
surely that it was Nicolette, and that she had brought her
up.&nbsp; And she made her be washed and bathed, and sojourn
there a full eight days.&nbsp; And she took a plant which was
called Celandine and anointed herself with it, and she was as
beautiful as she had ever been at any time.&nbsp; And she clad
herself in rich silk stuffs, of which the lady had good store,
and she sat her down in the room on a quilted coverlet of
cloth-of-silk, and called the lady, and told her to go for
Aucassin her friend.&nbsp; And she did so.&nbsp; And when she
came to the palace she found Aucassin weeping and lamenting for
Nicolette his love, because she tarried so long.&nbsp; And the
lady accosted him and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aucassin, now make no more lament, but come away with
me, and I will show you the thing in the world you love best, for
it is <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Nicolette, your sweet friend, who
from far land is come to seek you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Aucassin was
glad.</p>
<p><i>Here they sing</i>.</p>
<p>Now when Aucassin did hear<br />
Of his bright-of-favour fere,<br />
That she had arrived the shore,<br />
Glad was he, he ne&rsquo;er was more.<br />
With the dame he went his way,<br />
Till the house made stop nor stay.<br />
To the chamber went they in<br />
Where sat Nicolette within.<br />
When she saw her lover there,<br />
Glad she was, so was she ne&rsquo;er.<br />
Towards him to her feet leapt she.<br />
Aucassin, when he did see,<br />
Both his arms to her he holds,<br />
Gently to his bosom folds,<br />
Kisses her on eyes and face.<br />
So they left him the night&rsquo;s space,<br />
Till the morrow&rsquo;s morning-tide<br />
Aucassin took her to bride,<br />
<!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Many days they then did fare,<br />
And their pleasure did enjoy.<br />
Now has Aucassin his joy,<br />
Nicolette too the same way.<br />

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
